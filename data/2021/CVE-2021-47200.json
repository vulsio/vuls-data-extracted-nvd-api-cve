				"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndrm/prime: Fix use after free in mmap with drm_gem_ttm_mmap\n\ndrm_gem_ttm_mmap() drops a reference to the gem object on success. If\nthe gem object's refcount == 1 on entry to drm_gem_prime_mmap(), that\ndrop will free the gem object, and the subsequent drm_gem_object_get()\nwill be a UAF. Fix by grabbing a reference before calling the mmap\nhelper.\n\nThis issue was forseen when the reference dropping was adding in\ncommit 9786b65bc61ac (\"drm/ttm: fix mmap refcounting\"):\n  \"For that to work properly the drm_gem_object_get() call in\n  drm_gem_ttm_mmap() must be moved so it happens before calling\n  obj->funcs->mmap(), otherwise the gem refcount would go down\n  to zero.\"",
