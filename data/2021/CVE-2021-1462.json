To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need to have a valid Administrator account on an affected system.\r\nThe vulnerability is due to incorrect privilege assignment. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by logging in to an affected system with an Administrator account and creating a malicious file, which the system would parse at a later time. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to obtain root privileges on the affected system.Cisco&nbsp;has released software updates that address this vulnerability.
