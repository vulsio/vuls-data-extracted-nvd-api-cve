				"description": "JSONata is a JSON query and transformation language. Starting in version 1.4.0 and prior to version 1.8.7 and 2.0.4, a malicious expression can use the transform operator to override properties on the `Object` constructor and prototype. This may lead to denial of service, remote code execution or other unexpected behavior in applications that evaluate user-provided JSONata expressions. This issue has been fixed in JSONata versions 1.8.7 and 2.0.4. Applications that evaluate user-provided expressions should update ASAP to prevent exploitation. As a workaround, one may apply the patch manually.",
