				"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnvme-multipath: defer partition scanning\n\nWe need to suppress the partition scan from occuring within the\ncontroller's scan_work context. If a path error occurs here, the IO will\nwait until a path becomes available or all paths are torn down, but that\naction also occurs within scan_work, so it would deadlock. Defer the\npartion scan to a different context that does not block scan_work.",
