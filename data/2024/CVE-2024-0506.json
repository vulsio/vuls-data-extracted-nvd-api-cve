				"description": "The Elementor Website Builder â€“ More than Just a Page Builder plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting via the $instance[alt] parameter in the get_image_alt function in all versions up to, and including, 3.18.3 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with contributor access or higher to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute if they can successfully trick a user into performing an action such as clicking on a link.",
