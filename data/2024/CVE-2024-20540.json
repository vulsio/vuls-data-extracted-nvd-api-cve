				"description": "A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Unified Contact Center Management Portal (Unified CCMP) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker with low privileges to conduct a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against a user of the interface.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability exists because the web-based management interface does not properly validate user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by injecting malicious code into a specific page of the interface. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive browser-based information. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker must have at least a Supervisor role on an affected device.",
