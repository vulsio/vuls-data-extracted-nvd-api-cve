				"description": "The FunnelKit Funnel Builder Pro plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the 'allow_iframe_tag_in_post' function which uses the 'wp_kses_allowed_html' filter to globally allow script and iframe tags in posts in all versions up to, and including, 3.4.5. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.",
