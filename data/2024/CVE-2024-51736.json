				"description": "Symphony process is a module for the Symphony PHP framework which executes commands in sub-processes. On Windows, when an executable file named `cmd.exe` is located in the current working directory it will be called by the `Process` class when preparing command arguments, leading to possible hijacking. This issue has been addressed in release versions 5.4.46, 6.4.14, and 7.1.7. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.",
