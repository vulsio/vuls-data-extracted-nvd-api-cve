				"description": "A vulnerability in the AnyConnect firewall for Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software and Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass a configured access control list (ACL) and allow traffic that should have been denied to flow through an affected device. This vulnerability is due to a logic error in populating group ACLs when an AnyConnect client establishes a new session toward an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by establishing an AnyConnect connection to the affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to bypass configured ACL rules.",
