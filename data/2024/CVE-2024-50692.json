				"description": "SunGrow WiNet-SV200.001.00.P027 and earlier versions contains hardcoded MQTT credentials that allow an attacker to send arbitrary commands to an arbitrary inverter. It is also possible to impersonate the broker, because TLS is not used to identify the real MQTT broker. This means that MQTT communications are vulnerable to MitM attacks at the TCP/IP level.",
