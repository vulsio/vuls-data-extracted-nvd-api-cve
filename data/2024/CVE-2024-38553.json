				"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet: fec: remove .ndo_poll_controller to avoid deadlocks\n\nThere is a deadlock issue found in sungem driver, please refer to the\ncommit ac0a230f719b (\"eth: sungem: remove .ndo_poll_controller to avoid\ndeadlocks\"). The root cause of the issue is that netpoll is in atomic\ncontext and disable_irq() is called by .ndo_poll_controller interface\nof sungem driver, however, disable_irq() might sleep. After analyzing\nthe implementation of fec_poll_controller(), the fec driver should have\nthe same issue. Due to the fec driver uses NAPI for TX completions, the\n.ndo_poll_controller is unnecessary to be implemented in the fec driver,\nso fec_poll_controller() can be safely removed.",
