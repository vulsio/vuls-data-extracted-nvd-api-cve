				"description": "iXsystems TrueNAS CORE tarfile.extractall Directory Traversal Remote Code Execution Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows network-adjacent attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of iXsystems TrueNAS devices. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.\n\nThe specific flaw exists within the tarfile.extractall method. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of a user-supplied path prior to using it in file operations. An attacker can leverage this in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to execute code in the context of root. Was ZDI-CAN-25626.",
