The vulnerability arises from the improper use of the eval function, allowing a malicious or compromised LLM hosting provider to execute arbitrary commands on the client's machine. This issue was fixed in version 0.10.13. The exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to a hosting provider gaining full control over client machines.",
