				"description": "An arbitrary file creation vulnerability exists in PaperCut NG/MF that only affects Windows servers with Web Print enabled. This specific flaw exists within the image-handler process, which can incorrectly create files that don’t exist when a maliciously formed payload is provided. This can lead to local privilege escalation.\n\nNote: \n\nThis CVE has been split into two (CVE-2024-4712 and CVE-2024-8405) and it’s been rescored with a \"Privileges Required (PR)\" rating of low, and “Attack Complexity (AC)” rating of low, reflecting the worst-case scenario where an Administrator has granted local login access to standard network users on the host server.",
