Prior to commit 94ba0dadc2cf38e8f81c3936974c167219878edd, interactions with different AI services are vulnerable to admin-initiated SSRF attacks. Versions of the plugin that include commit 94ba0dadc2cf38e8f81c3936974c167219878edd contain a patch. As a workaround, one may disable the discourse-ai plugin.\n",
