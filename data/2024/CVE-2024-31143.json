				"description": "An optional feature of PCI MSI called \"Multiple Message\" allows a\ndevice to use multiple consecutive interrupt vectors.  Unlike for MSI-X,\nthe setting up of these consecutive vectors needs to happen all in one\ngo.  In this handling an error path could be taken in different\nsituations, with or without a particular lock held.  This error path\nwrongly releases the lock even when it is not currently held.\n",
