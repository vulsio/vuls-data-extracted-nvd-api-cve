				"description": "The Snowflake Connector for Python provides an interface for developing Python applications that can connect to Snowflake and perform all standard operations. Prior to version 3.12.3, when the logging level was set by the user to DEBUG, the Connector could have logged Duo passcodes (when specified via the `passcode` parameter) and Azure SAS tokens. Additionally, the SecretDetector logging formatter, if enabled, contained bugs which caused it to not fully redact JWT tokens and certain private key formats. Snowflake released version 3.12.3 of the Snowflake Connector for Python, which fixes the issue. In addition to upgrading, users should review their logs for any potentially sensitive information that may have been captured.",
