				"description": "A vulnerability in the Cisco AnyConnect VPN server of Cisco Meraki MX and Cisco Meraki Z Series Teleworker Gateway devices could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to hijack an AnyConnect VPN session or cause a denial of service (DoS) condition for individual users of the AnyConnect VPN service on an affected device.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is due to weak entropy for handlers that are used during the VPN authentication process as well as a race condition that exists in the same process. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by correctly guessing an authentication handler and then sending crafted HTTPS requests to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to take over the AnyConnect VPN session from a target user or prevent the target user from establishing an AnyConnect VPN session with the affected device.",
