				"description": "Litestar is an Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface (ASGI) framework. In versions 2.10.0 and prior, Litestar's `docs-preview.yml` workflow is vulnerable to Environment Variable injection which may lead to secret exfiltration and repository manipulation. This issue grants a malicious actor the permission to write issues, read metadata, and write pull requests. In addition, the `DOCS_PREVIEW_DEPLOY_TOKEN` is exposed to the attacker. Commit 84d351e96aaa2a1338006d6e7221eded161f517b contains a fix for this issue.",
