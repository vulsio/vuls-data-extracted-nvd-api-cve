				"description": "A Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability exists in the profile picture upload functionality of the Lollms application, specifically in the parisneo/lollms-webui repository, affecting versions up to 7.3.0. This vulnerability allows attackers to change a victim's profile picture without their consent, potentially leading to a denial of service by overloading the filesystem with files. Additionally, this flaw can be exploited to perform a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) attack, enabling attackers to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the context of the victim's browser session. The issue is resolved in version 9.3.",
