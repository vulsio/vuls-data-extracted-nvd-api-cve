				"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmedia: vivid: fix buffer overwrite when using > 32 buffers\n\nThe maximum number of buffers that can be requested was increased to\n64 for the video capture queue. But video capture used a must_blank\narray that was still sized for 32 (VIDEO_MAX_FRAME). This caused an\nout-of-bounds write when using buffer indices >= 32.\n\nCreate a new define MAX_VID_CAP_BUFFERS that is used to access the\nmust_blank array and set max_num_buffers for the video capture queue.\n\nThis solves a crash reported by:\n\n\thttps://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=219258",
