				"description": "A vulnerability in the Live Data server of Cisco Unified Intelligence Center could allow an unauthenticated, local attacker to read and modify data in a repository that belongs to an internal service on an affected device.\r\n\r This vulnerability is due to insufficient access control implementations on cluster configuration CLI requests. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a cluster configuration CLI request to specific directories on an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to read and modify data that is handled by an internal service on the affected device.",
