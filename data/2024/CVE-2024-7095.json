				"id": "CVE-2024-7095",
				"description": "On affected platforms running Arista EOS with SNMP configured, if “snmp-server transmit max-size” is configured, under some circumstances a specially crafted packet can cause the snmpd process to leak memory. This may result in the snmpd process being terminated (causing SNMP requests to time out until snmpd is restarted) and memory pressure for other processes on the switch. Increased memory pressure can cause processes other than snmpd to be at risk for unexpected termination as well.",
