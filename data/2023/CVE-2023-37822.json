				"id": "CVE-2023-37822",
				"description": "The Eufy Homebase 2 before firmware version 3.3.4.1h creates a dedicated wireless network for its ecosystem, which serves as a proxy to the end user's primary network. The WPA2-PSK generation of this dedicated network is flawed and solely based on the serial number. Due to the flawed generation process, the WPA2-PSK can be brute forced offline within seconds. This vulnerability allows an attacker in proximity to the dedicated wireless network to gain unauthorized access to the end user's primary network. The only requirement of the attack is proximity to the dedicated wireless network.",
