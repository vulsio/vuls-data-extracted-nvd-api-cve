				"description": "A vulnerability in Cisco TelePresence CE and RoomOS could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to view sensitive information on an affected device.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability exists because the affected software performs improper bounds checks. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted request to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause an out-of-bounds read that discloses sensitive information.\r\nNote: This vulnerability only affects Cisco Webex Desk Hub.\r\nThere are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.",
