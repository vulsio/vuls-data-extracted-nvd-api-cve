				"description": "Kyocera Device Manager before 3.1.1213.0 allows NTLM credential exposure during UNC path authentication via a crafted change from a local path to a UNC path. It allows administrators to configure the backup location of the database used by the application. Attempting to change this location to a UNC path via the GUI is rejected due to the use of a \\ (backslash) character, which is supposed to be disallowed in a pathname. Intercepting and modifying this request via a proxy, or sending the request directly to the application endpoint, allows UNC paths to be set for the backup location. Once such a location is set, Kyocera Device Manager attempts to confirm access and will try to authenticate to the UNC path; depending on the configuration of the environment, this may authenticate to the UNC with Windows NTLM hashes. This could allow NTLM credential relaying or cracking attacks.",
