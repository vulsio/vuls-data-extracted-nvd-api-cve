				"description": "A Cross-Protocol Scripting vulnerability is found in Apache Kvrocks.\n\nSince Kvrocks didn't detect if \"Host:\" or \"POST\" appears in RESP requests,\na valid HTTP request can also be sent to Kvrocks as a valid RESP request \nand trigger some database operations, which can be dangerous when \nit is chained with SSRF.\n\nIt is similiar to CVE-2016-10517 in Redis.\n\nThis issue affects Apache Kvrocks: from the initial version to the latest version 2.11.0.\n\nUsers are recommended to upgrade to version 2.11.1, which fixes the issue.",
