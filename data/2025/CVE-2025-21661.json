				"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ngpio: virtuser: fix missing lookup table cleanups\n\nWhen a virtuser device is created via configfs and the probe fails due\nto an incorrect lookup table, the table is not removed. This prevents\nsubsequent probe attempts from succeeding, even if the issue is\ncorrected, unless the device is released. Additionally, cleanup is also\nneeded in the less likely case of platform_device_register_full()\nfailure.\n\nBesides, a consistent memory leak in lookup_table->dev_id was spotted\nusing kmemleak by toggling the live state between 0 and 1 with a correct\nlookup table.\n\nIntroduce gpio_virtuser_remove_lookup_table() as the counterpart to the\nexisting gpio_virtuser_make_lookup_table() and call it from all\nnecessary points to ensure proper cleanup.",
